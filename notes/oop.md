## Pillars of OOP
1. Encapsulation 
 -  Wrapping up of data (properties) and function in a class
 -  Controlled modification from outside by
        - declaring properties as private
        - definiting get and set methods

2. Inheritance ==> Allows you to extend the behaviour of existing class. Inheritance defines "IS-A" relationship

3. Abstraction

4. Polymorphism ==> Multiple forms
