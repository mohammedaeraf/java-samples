## âœ… Assignment 19: Enhance Book Search Using `Optional` in Java

### **Objective:**

Refactor the existing Java program that searches for a `Book` in an `ArrayList<Book>` based on title, to use Java's `Optional` class. This approach promotes null safety and clean code practices.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

You are given a program that defines a `Book` class and stores multiple `Book` objects in an `ArrayList<Book>`. The task is to search for a book by its title and print the book details if found. If not found, display a friendly message.

Currently, the method to search for a book returns `null` if the book is not found. Your task is to:

1. Replace the usage of `null` with `Optional`.
2. Use modern Java constructs like `ifPresent()`, `orElse()`, etc., to handle the returned value.

---

### **Class Specification:**

#### 1. `Book` class

* Fields:

  * `int id`
  * `String title`
  * `String author`
* Constructor and `toString()` method for displaying book details.

#### 2. `Library` class

* Field:

  * `ArrayList<Book> books`
* Method:

  * `Optional<Book> findBookByTitle(String title)`

    * Returns an `Optional<Book>` instead of returning `null`.

#### 3. `Main` class

* Create multiple `Book` objects and store them in the library.
* Call `findBookByTitle(...)`.
* Print details using `Optional` methods:

  * `ifPresent()`

### **Expected Output Example:**

```text
Searching for: Java Basics
Book Found: ID=1, Title=Java Basics, Author=John Doe

Searching for: Unknown Book
Book not found.
```
